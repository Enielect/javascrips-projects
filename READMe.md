# Welcome to a few of my javascript projects I am practicing with.

These include varous projects ranging from a book-list to a countdown timer, some nice 
animations and so much more. These projects include:


## Book-list

This enables one to store info of books e.g name, isbn author. The info placed in the input fields are projected on the body of the page in wonderful style. You are provided with an option to delete the book from the list.

## Countdown

This provides a set of boxes which track the time left to a particular deadline. Just like how a normal countdown works. _There should be an upgrade that lets you set deadline time so that the countdown works with whatever you provided_

## Menu list

This is a nice ways show info in the DOM based on some available options. The user is able to filter a set of items based on what they prefer.

## Nav-bar

This is just a basic nav bar which has different layout based on the screen size.

## FAQ card

This depicts the popular system of how **FAQs** work generally. You see a bunch of questions, on clicking them they expand to show the answer and on toggle of another question the previously opened one collapses.

## Scroll-project

This takes advantage of scrolling functionality available in javascript to enable the scrolling of a website as seamless as possible.

## Sub-projects
This contains some extra projects:
 -  Animated Text:  It animates the the display of some preset text in a wonderful fasion that mimics the time steps that occur as if you were to be typing the text.
 - Carousel: This automates the scrolling of several pictures in a box every second.
 - falling-heart: This is an animation that has blue hearts falling from the top of the screen like forever.
 - nav: This is just smaller version of the **Nav-bar** stated earlier.
 - pop: An animation that has a button where you can increase the amount of time a particular text is generated and after a few second they start popping off the screen one after the other.

## Tab-project
This provides a way reveal different informarion (tests) based on different buttons.
These buttons convey what might be hidden, on click removes the old interface carrying 
the previous text and exposes something new based on what was clicked.

## Video project
This basically just contains an interface which containes a video in the background covered by a modal. There is a  button which allow you to pause/play the video in the background.
